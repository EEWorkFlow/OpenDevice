Raspberry Pi
-----------------------------------------------

The Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers developed 
in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to promote the 
teaching of basic computer science in schools and in developing countries.
The original model became far more popular than anticipated, selling 
outside of its target market for uses such as robotics. Peripherals (
including keyboards, mice and cases) are not included with the Raspberry Pi. 
Some accessories however have been included in several official and 
unofficial bundles.

According to the Raspberry Pi Foundation, over 5 million Raspberry Pis 
have been sold before February 2015, making it the best-selling British 
computer. By November 2016 they had sold 11 million units in March 2017 
12.5m making it the third best-selling "general purpose computer" ever.
